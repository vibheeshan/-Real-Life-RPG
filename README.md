# 🎮 Real-Life RPG

> *Level Up Your Real Life.*

Real-Life RPG transforms daily habits into a gamified adventure. Users gain experience points, level up, unlock skills, and defeat real-world challenges like exams and distractions.

Instead of tracking productivity, the application converts life progress into a dynamic RPG system powered by behavior-based mechanics. **It turns growth into gameplay.**
